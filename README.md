# Module 2 Challenge: Portfolio

## Description
The goal of this project was to build my own portfolio from scratch with the skills I have gained thus far in the coding bootcamp. The idea behind this portfolio is that I can use it to give future employers a brief look into my capabilities and show what applications I have deployed. This project taught me a lot about using my resources to find ways to solve problems with building a webpage.
