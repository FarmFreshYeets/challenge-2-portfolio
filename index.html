            <p>
                My name is Camden Grant Van Sciver. I was born at the very end of 2002 in Mesa, Arizona. Having been born in the 21st Century, 
                the internet has always been part of my life. My parents introduced me to computers at a young age and I've always been fascinated by 
                their capabilities and versatility.
            </p>
            <p>
                I aspire to be a developer who can create applications that are pleasing to the eye and impressive in solving real problems. In addition 
                to using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build websites, I have some self-taught experience with Python. I plan to fully master any language 
                I come in contact with to increase my strength as a web-developer and coder.
